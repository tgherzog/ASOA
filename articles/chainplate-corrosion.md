title: Chainplate Corrosion
original: "Chainplate Corrosion.pdf"

The original chainplates on the Seabreeze were made from a type of stainless
steel that contained only modest quantities of chromium and nickel, and
little or no molybdenum. They are prone to failure caused by corrosion when
subjected to continued deck leaks. The situation is made worse when the deck
penetration is sealed while water is trapped below it.


G. Butler and H. C. K. Ison explain the failure mechanism in [Corrosion and
its Prevention in Waters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0882755153).
They state on page 76:


>"The corrosion resistance of the stainless steels is due to the formation of a very thin
passivating film on the metal surface. Such a film forms spontaneously on
exposure of the clean metal surface to dry air or more rapidly on immersion
in an oxidising agent such as nitric acid. When such a surface is immersed in
water containing oxygen, a dynamic equilibriu mis set up between alternate
breakdown and repair of the film. If, however,
such film repair is prevented by lack of oxygen access severe corrosion can
take place at a rate comparable with that of iron or mild steel. Such
conditions can arise beneath debris, barnacles or in crevices (Pl. 9). In the
use of stainless steels this behavior should always be borne in mind and
the installation designed so as to minimize fouling of the metal surface and
where possible to also provide for adequate cleaning of the surface.
All possible crevices should be eliminated by design; e.g. by replacing
riveted joints with welded ones. Where this is not possible the situation may
be improved by sealing the joints, but this method is not completely
reliable.


>"The range of environments in which the stainless steels are able to remain
passive in markedly broadened by increasing the chromium content and to a
lesser extent by increasing the nickel. In this connection supplementary
alloying with small amounts of molybdenum is also advantageous.


>"When corrosion of stainless steel does occur it is usually localized. The
presence of chloride increases the susceptibility to pitting attack
particularly at grain boundaries. This tendency is large with higher carbon
contents but it can be reduced by supplementary alloying with small
amounts of molybdenum or silicon. Increase in pH decreases the number of pits
and their rate of growth."
