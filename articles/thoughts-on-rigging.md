Our boats were built in the late sixties and early seventies, we usually
don’t know the age of the rigging unless we are an "original owner. Most
boats aren't used in a manner that overstresses the rig so the problem with
rig failures is usually due to age. There have been a number of chainplate
failures due to stress crack corrosion so this is certainly a good place to
start your job. Lower swage fittings are prone to the same failure problem.

Unfortunately, Allied did a great job in covering the chainplates with
fiberglass and they all seem to be located back in a locker that is very
inaccessible. We had an aft lower plate break under sail. We were living
aboard and under way so it was imperative that we make a good repair.
We found a good metal shop, in the area we were transiting, that stocked
various stainless alloys. I chiseled off the fiberglass to expose the plates
and bolts. On removing the broken plate you could easily see the
corrosion, just below the deck line, where water seeped in through the
deck calking and set up the right conditions for stress crack corrosion. All
our plates were the same size and hole spacing so I took one to the shop
and had them duplicate a full set. We replaced all the plates at that
anchorage, with the rig up, unfastening one shroud at a time. We did not
remove the fore or back stays since these attachments are completely
different from the shrouds. Only one of our plates was corroded, and it had
magnetic properties indicating 304 stainless. The other five were in good
shape and had no magnetic attraction, indicating probably 316 alloy.

While still cruising, at a later time, we decided to prepare the boat for an
offshore trip to Bermuda. We thought re-rigging would be very prudent
preparation, and decided to make all stays and shrouds the same size
cable, and one size larger than the uppers in the original plan. I believe
we purchased three hundred feet of cable, that was a bit more than the
actual total length required, but the price/hundred feet, rather than the
price/foot made it a less expensive purchase. We decided on Staylock
terminal fittings, they are very similar to Norseman but were more
available where we were located. We figured out how much cable we
would need, got the terminals in hand, and replaced one stay or shroud at
a time. Stainless 1 x 19 cable is pretty tough to cut, particularly if you’re
not at home in your shop. We carried a small clamp on vise so this was
mounted on a fender board and helped hold the cable. I think I cut it
using a small abrasive cut-off wheel. When estimating length you need to
look at the cable you are replacing and see where the turnbuckle is
adjusted to, you may want to make the new cable a little longer or shorter
to get the adjustment in the middle of the screw adjusting threads. All this
measuring business is based on having your rig set up so the masthead is
equidistant from each rail and that the mast is raked the way you want it.
Our rigging plan calls for about 15" of rake for a sloop, when the boat is on
its lines, fore and aft. Now with a cable removed and a knowledge of any
changes, be sure you have a toggle between the turnbuckle and the
chainplate, you can put the upper terminal fitting on. These are a bit
tough to do but ordinary tools will suffice if you follow manufacturer’s
directions. Now you can secure the upper terminal of the new cable
alongside the upper terminal of the old cable and see what length you
need to cut, cut the cable and put on the lower fitting. One of the good
things about these screw-on fittings is that you fill them with silicone so
they never get water inside, that’s probably the real culprit in cable
degradation. Put the new finished cable back on the rig and tighten it up.
I think we allowed an inch for stretch, not that you stretch the cable but
that it is difficult to get the cable pulled really tight while measuring
alongside the old cable. New cable comes off a roll, with memory, old
cable has been tensioned straight. Now is a good time to clean the
turnbuckles, too, then we coated ours with anhydrous lanolin, available at
the drug store. You can also buy special marine "stuff" for this purpose.

When you are replacing the uppers is a good time to re-fasten the shroud
to the spreader end. Incidentally, our spreaders have a fore/aft and a
vertical slot in the end of the spreader. You put the slack cable in the
fore/aft slot and rotate it to the vertical and the cable is locked in the end
of the spreader. All boats may not be the same, you may need to wire the
cable to the spreader end. Get some of the annealed stainless wire used
for "mousing" an anchor shackle, it's a convenient size and easily worked.

Spreaders should be angled up, slightly, the rig plan specified 4" at the
spreader end. This is to keep the spreader in compression when it is under
load. I think I made cardboard template so I could adjust the spreader to
this angle. The spreader length is 3' 6". When the new upper shroud was
in the spreader end and the spreader was angled up 4" I put a copper
cable clamp on the cable, above and below the spreader. They will never
move. A spreader boot covers the clamps.

We sailed on a friend's boat one time when the leeward upper shroud
came off the spreader end. No one noticed until we tacked and the mast
began to whip around and looked like we might lose the rig. The owner
had been re-varnishing his wooden spreaders and had forgotten to
refasten the uppers to the spreader ends. We managed to get things under
control but I wanted to be sure that would never happen on our boat.

Good luck on the project. A re-rig takes a little time and, of course, costs
money, but it puts your mind at ease on the security of the rig when you
get into some heavy going, wind or seas.
