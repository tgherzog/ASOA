The [Allied Seabreeze](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/seabreeze-35-allied)
was designed by [MacLear & Harris](https://sailboatdata.com/designer/maclear-harris)
in 1962. A total of 135
of these magnificant boats were built between 1963 and 1972. Of these, we know
of only two boats that no longer exist. One is known to have been destroyed on
a reef in the South Pacific and the other was scraped after surviving a fire
and was considered to be too much of a project to restore. The remainder of
these boats, many belonging to members of the Association, are actively sailed
or are being refurbished or restored for future sailing.

In an interview, Frank MacLear said the boat was designed to be sailed anywhere
in the world. She is a small boat at 34.5 feet overall, but a worthy passage
maker. Beyond her seakindly and lovely sailing characteristics, she is a beauty
to behold. She was designed by very capable naval architects and built by a
company with impeccable credentials. Her hull and deck are solid and her
interior thoughtfully laid out.

As a centerboarder, she is capable of safely traversing shoal waters, gunk
holing remote regions, enjoying anchorages impossible for boats of deeper
drafts, and searching far up stream for more secure harbors and refuge from
approaching storms. At sea she is stable and comfortable, but as a
centerboarder, the capable sailor will know to reduce sail earlier than on
deeper keeled boats.
